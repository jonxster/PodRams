/// If an atom:entry is copied from one feed into another feed, then the
/// source atom:feed's metadata (all child elements of atom:feed other
/// than the atom:entry elements) MAY be preserved within the copied
/// entry by adding an atom:source child element, if it is not already
/// present in the entry, and including some or all of the source feed's
/// Metadata elements as the atom:source element's children.  Such
/// metadata SHOULD be preserved if the source atom:feed contains any of
/// the child elements atom:author, atom:contributor, atom:rights, or
/// atom:category and those child elements are not present in the source
/// atom:entry.
///
/// The atom:source element is designed to allow the aggregation of
/// entries from different feeds while retaining information about an
/// entry's source feed. For this reason, Atom Processors that are
/// performing such aggregation SHOULD include at least the required
/// feed-level Metadata elements (atom:id, atom:title, and atom:updated)
/// in the atom:source element.
