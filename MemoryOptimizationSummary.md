### Memory Optimization Manager Features

```swift
class MemoryOptimizationManager: ObservableObject {
    // Configuration
    let maxEpisodesPerPodcast = 15
    let maxShowNotesLength = 2000
    let maxSearchCacheSize = 20
    let imageMemoryCacheLimit = 15 * 1024 * 1024 // 15MB
    
    // Key Methods
    func optimizePodcastMemoryUsage([Podcast])
    func setupMemoryPressureMonitoring()
    func performMemoryCleanup()
    func clearCaches()
}
```

### Podcast Memory Optimization

```swift
extension Podcast {
    func optimizeMemoryUsage() {
        // Limit episodes to 15 most recent
        if episodes.count > 15 {
            episodes = Array(episodes.prefix(15))
        }
        
        // Truncate show notes to 2000 characters
        for episode in episodes {
            if let notes = episode.showNotes, notes.count > 2000 {
                episode.showNotes = String(notes.prefix(2000)) + "..."
            }
        }
    }
    
    func estimatedMemoryUsage() -> Int {
        // Calculate memory usage for monitoring
    }
}
```

### Image Cache Optimization

```swift
static let optimizedImageCache: NSCache<NSURL, NSImage> = {
    let cache = NSCache<NSURL, NSImage>()
    cache.totalCostLimit = 15 * 1024 * 1024 // 15MB limit
    cache.countLimit = 100 // Max 100 images
    cache.evictsObjectsWithDiscardedContent = true
    return cache
}()
```
